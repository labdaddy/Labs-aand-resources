reddit kubernetes suggestion

Setup a Kubeadm based cluster to an enterprise level. What I mean by this is do the following:

Appropriate RBAC + Identity integration

Namespace isolation

Some persistent volume provider

Appropriate PodSecurityPolicy

Host protection endpoints

Monitoring of the hosts/kubernetes layer itself

Kubernetes auditing

Monitoring of pods, services, PVC's

Full NetworkPolicy layer so that there's actual network security

Container Security Monitoring

These are all pretty much mandatory if you want to use Kubernetes
